Presently I'm just a student practically speaking.
My skill set wide and varied, yet not what I would call practically functional.
I'm interested in developing software using JavaScript.
I'm currently learning Visual Studio Code, Python, and Git/GitHub.
I'm looking to collaborate on developing web deveopment projects using JavaScript in the near future.

I'm presently brushing up on my studies in mathematics.

I'm elderly. I've studied many aspects of information technology, but I'm very rusty.
I dropped out about 2011.
I've heard it is never too late to begin.
I guess I'll find out.
